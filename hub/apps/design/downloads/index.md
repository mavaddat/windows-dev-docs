# Design resources for Windows apps

This topic provides a variety of design and UI-related resources for creating visually appealing and user-friendly Windows applications.

## Fonts

The Windows type system helps you create structure and hierarchy in your content in order to maximize legibility and readability in your UI (for more details, see [Segoe UI font family](/typography/font-list/segoe-ui)).

The following fonts are recommended:

- [Segoe UI Variable](https://aka.ms/SegoeUIVariable) (see [Typography in Windows](../signature-experiences/typography.md))
- [Segoe Fluent Icons](https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons) (see [Segoe Fluent Icons font](../style/segoe-fluent-icons-font.md))
- [Segoe MDL2](https://aka.ms/segoemdl2) (see [Segoe MDL2 Assets icons](../style/segoe-ui-symbol-font.md))

- **Styles and tokens**: Predefined colors, typography, and spacing.

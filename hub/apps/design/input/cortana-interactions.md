# Cortana interactions in Windows apps

>[!WARNING]
> This feature is no longer supported as of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update (version 2004, codename "20H1").

Extend the basic functionality of **Cortana** with voice commands that launch and execute a single action in a Windows application.

The target app can be launched in the foreground (the app takes focus and **Cortana** is dismissed) or activated in the background (**Cortana** retains focus but provides results from the app), depending on the complexity of the interaction. Generally, voice commands that require additional context or user input are best handled in a foreground app, while basic commands can be handled in **Cortana** through a background app.

By integrating the basic functionality of your app, and providing a central entry point for the user to accomplish most of the tasks without opening your app directly, **Cortana** becomes a liaison between your app and the user. Providing this shortcut to app functionality and reducing the need to switch apps, can save the user significant time and effort.

> [!NOTE]
> A voice command is a single utterance with a specific intent, defined in a Voice Command Definition (VCD) file, directed at an installed app via **Cortana**.
>
> A VCD file defines one or more voice commands, each with a unique intent.
>
> Voice command definitions can vary in complexity. They can support anything from a single, constrained utterance to a collection of more flexible, natural language utterances, all denoting the same intent.

# Launch the default Windows app for a URI

Learn how to launch the default app for a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URIs allow you to launch another app to perform a specific task. This topic also provides an overview of the many URI schemes built into Windows. You can launch custom URIs too. For more info about registering a custom URI scheme and handling URI activation, see [Handle URI activation](handle-uri-activation.md).

URI schemes let you open apps by clicking hyperlinks. Just as you can start a new email using **mailto:**, you can open the default web browser using **http:** or **https:**.

This topic describes the following URI schemes built into Windows:

| URI Scheme | Launches |
| ----------:|----------|
| [bingmaps:, ms-drive-to:, and ms-walk-to:](#maps-app-uri-schemes) | Maps app |
| [http: and https:](#http-uri-scheme) | Default web browser |
| [mailto:](#email-uri-scheme) | Default email app |
| [microsoft-edge:](#microsoft-edge-uri-scheme) | Microsoft Edge browser |
| [ms-chat:](#messaging-app-uri-scheme) | Messaging app |
| [ms-people:](#people-app-uri-scheme) | People app |
| [ms-photos:](#photos-app-uri-scheme) | Photos app |
| [ms-recall:](/windows/ai/apis/recall#launch-click-to-do) | Click to do (part of [Recall](/windows/ai/apis/recall)) |
| [ms-settings:](#settings-app-uri-scheme) | Settings app |
| [ms-store:](#store-app-uri-scheme)  | Store app |
| [msnweather:](#weather-app-uri-scheme) | Weather app |

For example, the following URI opens the default browser and displays the Microsoft Bing web site: `https://bing.com/`.

You can also launch custom URI schemes too. If there is no app installed to handle that URI, you can recommend an app for the user to install. For more info, see [Recommend an app if one is not available to handle the URI](#recommend-an-app-if-one-is-not-available-to-handle-the-uri).

In general, your app can't select the app that is launched. The user determines which app is launched. More than one app can register to handle the same URI scheme. The exception to this is for reserved URI schemes. Registrations of reserved URI schemes are ignored. For the full list of reserved URI schemes, see [Handle URI activation](handle-uri-activation.md). In cases where more than one app may have registered the same URI scheme, your app can recommend a specific app to be launched. For more info, see [Recommend an app if one is not available to handle the URI](#recommend-an-app-if-one-is-not-available-to-handle-the-uri).

## Important APIs

The following Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs are used in this topic:

- [LaunchUriAsync](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync)
- [PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.preferredapplicationpackagefamilyname)
- [DesiredRemainingView](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.desiredremainingview)

Note that many WinRT APIs will work with other desktop apps with package identity. There are some exceptions, and most of these are related to APIs that are specific to UI rendering or input. Some of the **LauncherOptions**, such as [TreatAsUntrusted](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.treatasuntrusted), only work in UWP apps. To read more about enabling your desktop app to work with WinRT APIs, see [Call Windows Runtime APIs in desktop apps](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance).

## Call LaunchUriAsync to launch a URI

Use the [LaunchUriAsync](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync) method to launch a URI. When you call this method, your app must be the foreground app, that is, it must be visible to the user. This requirement helps ensure that the user remains in control. To meet this requirement, make sure that you tie all URI launches directly to the UI of your app. The user must always take some action to initiate a URI launch. In a UWP app, if you attempt to launch a URI and your app isn't in the foreground, the launch will fail and your error callback will be invoked.

First create a [System.Uri](/dotnet/api/system.uri) object to represent the URI, then pass that to the [LaunchUriAsync](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync) method. Use the return result to see if the call succeeded, as shown in the following example.

```cs
private async void launchURI_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
   // The URI to launch
   var bingUri = new Uri(@"https://www.bing.com");

   // Launch the URI
   var success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(bingUri);

   if (success)
   {
      // URI launched
   }
   else
   {
      // URI launch failed
   }
}
```

In some cases, the operating system will prompt the user to see if they actually want to switch apps.

:::image type="content" source="images/warningdialog.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a warning dialog overlayed on a grayed out background of the app. The dialog asks the user if they want to switch apps and has 'yes' and 'no' buttons in the bottom right. the 'no' button is highlighted.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This prompt is only supported by UWP apps. If Windows attempts to show this prompt for a desktop app, the launch will fail.

If your app is a UWP app, and you always want this prompt to occur, use the [Windows.System.LauncherOptions.TreatAsUntrusted](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.treatasuntrusted) property to tell the operating system to display a warning.

```cs
// The URI to launch
var uriBing = new Uri(@"http://www.bing.com");

// Set the option to show a warning
var promptOptions = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions
{
   TreatAsUntrusted = true
};

// Launch the URI
var success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriBing, promptOptions);
```

### Recommend an app if one is not available to handle the URI

In some cases, the user might not have an app installed to handle the URI that you are launching. By default, the operating system handles these cases by providing the user with a link to search for an appropriate app on the store. If you want to give the user a specific recommendation for which app to acquire in this scenario, you can do so by passing that recommendation along with the URI that you are launching.

Recommendations are also useful when more than one app has registered to handle a URI scheme. By recommending a specific app, Windows will open that app if it is already installed.

To make a recommendation, call the [Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(Uri, LauncherOptions)](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync#Windows_System_Launcher_LaunchUriAsync_Windows_Foundation_Uri_Windows_System_LauncherOptions_) method with [LauncherOptions.preferredApplicationPackageFamilyName](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.preferredapplicationpackagefamilyname) set to the package family name of the app in the store that you want to recommend. The operating system uses this info to replace the general option to search for an app in the store with a specific option to acquire the recommended app from the store.

```cs
// Set the recommended app
var options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions
{
    PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName = "Contoso.URIApp_8wknc82po1e",
    PreferredApplicationDisplayName = "Contoso URI App"
};

// Launch the URI and pass in the recommended app
// in case the user has no apps installed to handle the URI
var success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriContoso, options);
```

### Set remaining view preference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available in UWP apps. When used in a desktop app, the property will be ignored.

Source apps that call [LaunchUriAsync](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcher.launchuriasync) can request that they remain on screen after a URI launch. By default, Windows attempts to share all available space equally between the source app and the target app that handles the URI. Source apps can use the [DesiredRemainingView](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.desiredremainingview) property to indicate to the operating system that they prefer their app window to take up more or less of the available space. **DesiredRemainingView** can also be used to indicate that the source app doesn't need to remain on screen after the URI launch and can be completely replaced by the target app. This property only specifies the preferred window size of the calling app. It doesn't specify the behavior of other apps that may happen to also be on screen at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
>Â Windows takes into account multiple different factors when it determines the source app's final window size, for example, the preference of the source app, the number of apps on screen, the screen orientation, and so on. By setting [DesiredRemainingView](/uwp/api/windows.system.launcheroptions.desiredremainingview), you aren't guaranteed a specific windowing behavior for the source app.

```cs
// Set the desired remaining view.
var options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions
{
    DesiredRemainingView = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ViewSizePreference.UseLess
};

// Launch the URI
var success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriContoso, options);
```

## URI Schemes

The various URI schemes are described in this section.

### Email URI scheme

Use the **mailto:** URI scheme to launch the default mail app.

| URI Scheme |Results |
|------------|--------|
| `mailto:` | Launches the default email app. |
| `mailto:\[email address\]` | Launches the email app and creates a new message with the specified email address on the To line. Note that the email is not sent until the user taps send. |

### HTTP URI scheme

Use the **http:** URI scheme to launch the default web browser.

| URI Scheme | Results |
|------------|---------|
| `http:` or `https:` | Launches the default web browser. |

### Maps app URI schemes

Use the **bingmaps:**, **ms-drive-to:**, and **ms-walk-to:** URI schemes to [launch the Windows Maps app](launch-maps-app.md) to specific maps, directions, and search results. For example, the following URI opens the Windows Maps app and displays a map centered over New York City.

`bingmaps:?cp=40.726966~-74.006076`

:::image type="content" source="images/mapnyc.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Windows Maps app.":::

For more info, see [Launch the Windows Maps app](launch-maps-app.md). To use the map control in your UWP app, see [Display maps with 2D, 3D, and Streetside views](/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/display-maps). If you're using Windows App SDK 1.5 or later in a WinUI app or other desktop app, you can use the [MapControl](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.mapcontrol).

### Messaging app URI scheme

Use the **ms-chat:** URI scheme to launch the Microsoft Messaging app.

| URI scheme |Results |
|------------|--------|
| `ms-chat:` | Launches the Messaging app. |
| `ms-chat:?ContactID={contacted}` |  Allows the messaging application to be launched with a particular contactâs information.   |
| `ms-chat:?Body={body}` | Allows the messaging application to be launched with a string to use as the content of the message.|
| `ms-chat:?Addresses={address}&Body={body}` | Allows the messaging application to be launched with a particular addresses' information, and with a string to use as the content of the message. Note: Addresses can be concatenated. |
| `ms-chat:?TransportId={transportId}` | Allows the messaging application to be launched with a particular transport ID. |

### People app URI scheme

Use the **ms-people:** URI scheme to launch the People app.
For more info, see [Launch the People app](launch-people-app.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The People app is moving to the new Outlook. You can take your contacts with you by selecting **Export contacts** on the People app's toolbar and then importing them into the new Outlook. See [Manage your contacts and connect with people through the new Outlook for Windows (Preview)](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-your-contacts-and-connect-with-people-through-the-new-outlook-for-windows-preview-858a75e9-f61c-4fe2-b744-a8f45c84c7bf) for more information.

### Photos app URI scheme

Use the **ms-photos:** URI scheme to launch the Photos app to view an image or edit a video. For example:

| Operation | URI |
|----------|-----|
| View an image | `ms-photos:viewer?fileName=c:\users\userName\Pictures\image.jpg` |
| Edit a video | `ms-photos:videoedit?InputToken=123abc&Action=Trim&StartTime=01:02:03` |

> [!NOTE]
> If you are launching the Photos app from a UWP app, the URIs to edit a video or display an image are only available on desktop.

The following table lists additional supported URI schemes for the Photos app:

| URI scheme |Results |
|------------|--------|
| `ms-photos:viewer?fileName={filename}` | Launches the Photos app to view the specified image where {filename} is a fully-qualified path name. For example: `c:\users\userName\Pictures\ImageToView.jpg` |
| `ms-photos:videoedit?InputToken={input token}` | Launches the Photos app in video editing mode for the file represented by the file token. **InputToken** is required. Use the  [SharedStorageAccessManager](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.SharedStorageAccessManager) to get a token for a file. |
| `ms-photos:videoedit?Action={action}` | A parameter that indicates which video editing mode to open the Photos app in, where {action} is one of: **SlowMotion**, **FrameExtraction**, **Trim**, **View**, **Ink**. **Action** is required. |
| `ms-photos:videoedit?StartTime={timespan}` | An optional parameter that specifies where to start playing the video. `{timespan}` must be in the format `"hh:mm:ss.ffff"`. If not specified, defaults to `00:00:00.0000` |

### Settings app URI scheme

Use the **ms-settings:** URI scheme to [launch the Windows Settings app](launch-settings-app.md). Launching to the Settings app is an important part of writing a privacy-aware app. If your app can't access a sensitive resource, we recommend providing the user a convenient link to the privacy settings for that resource.

For example, the following URI opens the Settings app and displays the camera privacy settings:

`ms-settings:privacy-webcam`

:::image type="content" source="images/privacyawarenesssettingsapp.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Windows camera privacy settings.":::

For more info, see [Launch the Windows Settings app](launch-settings-app.md) and [Security and identity](../security/index.md).

### Store app URI scheme

Use the **ms-windows-store:** URI scheme to [launch the Microsoft Store app](launch-store-app.md). Open product detail pages, product review pages, and search pages, etc. For example, the following URI opens the Microsoft Store app and launches the home page of the Store.

`ms-windows-store://home/`

For more info, see [Using ms-windows-store URIs](launch-store-app.md).

### Weather app URI scheme

Use the **msnweather:** URI scheme to launch the Weather app.

| URI Scheme | Results |
|------------|---------|
| `msnweather://forecast?la=\[latitude\]&lo=\[longitude\]` | Launches the Weather app in the Forecast page based on a location geographic coordinates.<br>`latitude` refers to the latitude of the location.<br> `longitude` refers to the longitude of the location. |

### Microsoft Edge URI scheme

Use the **microsoft-edge:** URI scheme to launch the Microsoft Edge browser to a specified URL.

| URI Scheme | Results |
|------------|---------|
| `microsoft-edge:https://example.com/` | Opens the Microsoft Edge browser and navigates to `https://example.com/` |

You can use this URI scheme to launch the Microsoft Edge browser, regardless of the user's default browser setting.

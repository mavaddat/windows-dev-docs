# Windows app performance and fundamentals overview

Improving the performance and fundamentals of your application gives it a feeling of polish and craftsmanship, while saving your customers time, money, battery life, and development effort. Your app will consume less power, improving battery life and reducing carbon emissions. Apps run more smoothly on less expensive hardware. Your customers' productivity increases.

This page provides an overview of the technologies and development tools for measuring, understanding, and refining the performance of your Windows application. If you are writing a UWP application, be sure to also consult the [UWP Performance](/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/performance-and-xaml-ui) documentation.

## What is application performance and why is it important?

Performance in the context of an application usually revolves around _cost_. How long is it going to take to complete a particular task? How much of the system's resources will be used?

The answers to these questions play a fundamental role in the quality of a user's experience with an application (you can likely recall times where as a user, you have felt frustrated at an application for its poor performance!). As a developer, by keeping performance in mind, you will ensure that users of your applications don't experience that same frustration.

To learn more about the importance of performance and suggestions on how to get started, see this [introduction to the world of performance](introduction.md).

## What tools can I use to measure application performance?

There are a variety of different options available for measuring the performance of your Windows application.

If you are not sure what tools to choose, check out the article: [Choosing between Visual Studio Performance Profiler and Windows Performance Toolkit](./choose-between-tools.md).

### ![Visual Studio Icon](./images/vs.png) Visual Studio Performance Profiler

Visual Studio offers tooling to help you monitor your application and give you insights within your source. Visit the resources below to learn about how you can use these tools to optimize your code right from your development environment.

* [Measure app performance in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/profiling/)

* [Case Study: Using Visual Studio Profiler to reduce memory allocations in the Windows Terminal console host startup path](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/case-study-using-visual-studio-profiler-to-reduce-memory-allocations-in-the-windows-terminal-console-host-startup-path/)

### ![Windows Performance Analyzer Icon](./images/wpa.png) Windows Performance Toolkit

[Windows Performance Recorder](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder) and [Windows Performance Analyzer](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer) enable detailed monitoring and analysis of your application and the entire system using [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows). See the links below on how to get started.

### ![PerfView Icon](./images/dotnet-logo.png) PerfView

PerfView is an open source monitoring and analysis tool created by the .NET team for investigating .NET performance issues. Because of its ability to decode .NET symbols and managed memory, it is an ideal choice for managed applications.

* [PerfView GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview)

* PerfView Tutorial Series

### ![SizeBench Icon](./images/sizebench.png) SizeBench

SizeBench is a utility that helps you investigate and reduce the size of your compiled native code binaries (DLLs, EXEs, and other PE files).

### Community and support

* Performance problems in your compile-debug-test loop? Report them in the [Windows Dev Performance repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Dev-Performance) on GitHub.

### Performance and Sustainability

Performance engineering intersects directly with the sustainable software movement. Most electrical grids burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. As your application runs on a PC, it consumes incremental power that may be small for a single user but adds up as your user base grows.

# Get started: Publish your first app in the Microsoft Store

## Introduction

Distributing apps via Microsoft Store is a good choice for developers of any app type and size. The Microsoft Store is a centralized hub for Windows users to discover and install a wide range of apps, providing developers access to a vast audience of over a billion users across Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft Store also offers you various ways to make money from your apps, and lets you choose your own commerce platform and revenue sharing model. Microsoft Store also supports a wide range of app types and technologies, and allows you to bring your traditional desktop apps to the Store without changing your code or installer. 

For the full benefits of publishing your app into the Microsoft Store, please visit [benefits of distributing your apps via Microsoft Store.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2278501)

## Prerequisite

A Windows app developer account in Partner Center is needed before you start the app submission process. There are 2 types of developer accounts available in Partner Center: **Individual and Company**. 

To understand how to open developer account, you can watch the following video:

### [Open individual developer account](#tab/individual)

Who should select an individual account:
- **Independent developers** whose distribution of apps through the Store is **not in relation to their business, trade, or profession**
- **Small scale creators** producing content for non-commercial purposes 
- Individuals creating digital content as a **hobbyist, amateur, school, or personal project**
</br>

The individual account costs approximately **$19 USD**. It is a one-time registration fee. (The fees varies depending on your [country or region](./partner-center/account-types-locations-and-fees.md#developer-account-and-app-submission-markets))

</br>

For more details, refer [steps to create individual developer account](../publish/partner-center/open-a-developer-account.md).

### [Open company developer account](#tab/company)

Who should select a company account:
- **Independent developers and freelancers** whose distribution of apps through the Store is **in relation to their business, trade, or profession**
- **Businesses and Organizations** such as corporations, LLCs, partnerships, non-profits, or government organizations
- **Teams or Groups** within a company or organization
</br>

The company account costs approximately **$99 USD**. It is a one-time registration fee. (The fees varies depending on your [country or region](./partner-center/account-types-locations-and-fees.md#developer-account-and-app-submission-markets))

## Get started with app submission

### [MSIX or PWA](#tab/msix-pwa-getting-started)

**We recommend packaging your app (which is built with any app framework - UWP, Win32, PWA, WinApp SDK etc.), as [MSIX](/windows/msix/overview)**. By packaging your app as MSIX, you can take advantages of many features like a complimentary binary hosting (provided by Microsoft), complementary code signing (provided by Microsoft), Microsoft Store commerce platform, package flighting, advanced integration with Windows (to use features like share dialog, launch from Store etc), Windows 11 backup and restore etc.

For packaging your Win32 app as MSIX, follow these [steps](https://aka.ms/packagewin32asmsix).

**Note:** If you distribute your application as a web download (EXE /MSI) and you are planning to distribute it as a packaged application (MSIX) in the Store, you might want to prevent users from installing both versions or migrate users from the unpackaged web version to the Store version. Learn more about [transitioning users from web unpackaged to Store packaged app](../distribute-through-store/how-to-transition-users-from-your-web-unpackaged-app-to-store-packaged-app.md).

## Choice of commerce platform

Microsoft Store offers developers a flexible and transparent revenue sharing model (including in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and tips) that lets you choose your own commerce platform and keep 100% of the revenue for non-gaming apps, or use [Microsoft’s commerce platform](/windows/uwp/monetize/in-app-purchases-and-trials) and pay a competitive fee of 12% for games and 15% for apps. This means that you can maximize your profit and control your business model, while benefiting from the convenience and security of Microsoft’s commerce platform.

## App submission [MSIX/PWA]

To understand the submission process of MSIX apps, you can watch the following video.

## App certification process [MSIX/PWA]

When you finish creating your app's submission and click Submit to the Store, the submission enters the certification step. This process can take up to three business days. During certification, we will perform security tests, technical compliance tests and also a content compliance check on you app submission. You will be notified if your submission fails any of these tests. 

After your submission passes certification, on an average, customers will be able to see the app’s listing within 15 minutes depending on their location. You will be notified when your submission is published to the Store, and the app's status in the dashboard change to 'In Microsoft Store'.

To understand the certification process of MSIX apps, you can watch the following video.

### [MSI or EXE](#tab/msi-exe-getting-started)

Microsoft Store has allowed unpackaged applications since June 2021. To publish your application on the Store, you only need to share a link to your installer through the Partner Center and provide some additional information. Once your installer has been tested by our certification team and the submission is published, users will be able to locate your application in the Store and proceed with the installation.

For your installer to be accepted, it must adhere to the following recommendations:

- Must be a .msi or a .exe installer.
- Must be offline
- The binary hosted by the shared URL should remain unchanged.
- Your installer should only install the product intended by the user.

## App submission [MSI/EXE]

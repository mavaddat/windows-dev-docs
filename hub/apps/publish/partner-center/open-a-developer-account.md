See [App Developer Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=528905) for more info. If someone else is using a publisher display name for which you hold the trademark or other legal right, [contact Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/info/cpyrtInfrg.html).

After you've completed the signup process, your account will go through the verification process. For company accounts, we check to make sure another individual or company isn't already using your publisher display name. Our verification process also needs to confirm whether you’re associated with the company that you’re representing. This process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company (so make sure all of your contact information is up to date when you fill out the registration forms). You can't submit apps from a company account until it's been verified, but while you're waiting, you can [reserve an app name](/windows/apps/publish/?tabs=msix-pwa-getting-started#get-started-with-app-submission) continue building and testing apps, and work on getting your submissions ready.

You can check your verification status on the [Account settings](https://aka.ms/windowsdevaccountverification) page.

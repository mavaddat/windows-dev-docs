# Publish update to your add-on on the Store

You can make changes to a published add-on at any time. Add-on changes are submitted and published independently of your app, so you generally don't need to update the entire app in order to make changes to an add-on such as updating its price or description.

To submit updates, go to the add-on's page in Partner Center and click **Update**. This will create a new submission for the add-on, using the info from your previous submission as a starting point. Make the changes you'd like, and then click **Submit to the Store**.

If you'd like to remove an add-on you've previously offered, you can do this by creating a new submission and changing the [Distribution and visibility](./price-and-availability.md) option to **Hidden in the Store** with the **Stop acquisition** option. Be sure to update your app's code as needed to also remove references to the add-on.

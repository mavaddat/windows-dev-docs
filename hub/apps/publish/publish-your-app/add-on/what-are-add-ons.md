# What are add-ons?

Add-ons (also sometimes referred to as in-app products) are supplementary items for your app that can be purchased by customers. An add-on can be a fun new feature, a new game level, or anything else you think will keep users engaged. Not only are add-ons a great way to make money, but they help to drive customer interaction and engagement.

Add-ons are published through Partner Center, and require you to have an active developer account. You'll also need to enable the add-ons in your app's code.

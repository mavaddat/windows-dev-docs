# Guidance for app package management for MSI/EXE app

You can bring different packages for different architectures and language(s). For a combination of an architecture and language(s), you can only bring one package. For example, you can only bring one package for x64 and 'English' language combination.

While updating your app, you can delete the previous packages by going to Manage Packages page. Delete the package which is not required anymore and add a new package if required. After deleting or adding a new package, click on 'Save all' on the Manage packages page. This will upload the new changes.

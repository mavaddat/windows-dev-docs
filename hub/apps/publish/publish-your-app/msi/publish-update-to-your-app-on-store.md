# Publish update to your MSI/EXE app on the Store

We recommend you submit updates for your EXE or MSI apps through the Store. This ensures that new customers always get and install your latest app version.

The Store allows existing users to install in-app updates through your app, if your installer supports it. The Store does not provide these updates automatically or manually to existing users.

You can make changes to a published app at any time. To submit updates, go to the application's overview page in Partner Center. Navigate to the Update app section. An update submission has already been created using the info from your previous submission as a starting point.

Go to the required sections like [Pricing and availability](./price-and-availability.md), [Properties](./enter-app-properties.md), [Age ratings](./age-ratings.md), [Packages](./upload-app-packages.md) and [Store listing](./create-app-store-listing.md) to make the changes you'd like and save them. Then clickâ€¯ **Publish** on Manage Store listing page.

In the list of packages, you will see your existing package or the new package has been added. Now, click on **Save All**. You will see a message that your package is uploading and after a successful upload, you will get a message as Saved Successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> Any updates to EXE or MSI apps are subject to [Application Developer Agreement](/legal/windows/agreements/app-developer-agreement) and the [Microsoft Store Policies](../../store-policies.md), which may be updated from time to time. To add new functionalities that require written customer consent via your app update, you must provide notice to customers and get their written consent as required by law in the markets where you choose to distribute your app.

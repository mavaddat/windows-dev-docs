# Set app pricing for MSI/EXE app

## Configure app pricing

If your app pricing is based on one-time payment (collected through in-app purchase), you can choose Paid. You can choose Subscription if your app pricing is based on a recurring fee. Select freemium option if you let users use limited functionality in your app for free and upgrade through in-app purchases.

**Free trial**<br>_Selection required for paid and subscription apps only_

Developers who offer paid or subscription apps often allow customers to try out their app for free before paying. By default, free trials are disabled.

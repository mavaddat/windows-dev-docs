# Preview channel release notes for the Windows App SDK 1.6

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The preview channel is **not supported** for use in production environments, and apps that use the preview releases cannot be published to the Microsoft Store.

The preview channel includes releases of the Windows App SDK with [preview channel features](../release-channels.md#features-available-by-release-channel) in late stages of development. Preview releases do not include experimental features and APIs but may still be subject to breaking changes before the next stable release.

**Important links**:

- If you'd like to upgrade an existing app from an older version of the Windows App SDK to a newer version, see [Update existing projects to the latest release of the Windows App SDK](../update-existing-projects-to-the-latest-release.md).
- For documentation on preview releases, see [Install tools for preview and experimental channels of the Windows App SDK](../preview-experimental-install.md).

## Version 1.6 Preview 2 (1.6.0-preview2)

This is the latest release of the preview channel for version 1.6.

In an existing Windows App SDK 1.5 (from the stable channel) app, you can update your Nuget package to 1.6.0-preview2 (see the **Update a package** section in [Install and manage packages in Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#update-a-package)).

For the updated runtime and MSIX, see [Downloads for the Windows App SDK](../downloads.md).

### New features

#### Required C# project changes for 1.6-preview2

The C# project guidance from [1.6-preview1](#required-c-project-changes-for-16-preview1) is also required for this release.

#### Native AOT support

1.6-preview2 includes significant changes to update to the released [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) version 2.1.1 and make building more reliable for native Ahead-Of-Time compilation.

#### Updated Edge WebView2 SDK Integration

This release now references the released 1.0.2651.64 version of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package, which should fix issues hit with the prerelease version referenced in 1.6-preview1. As noted in 1.6-preview1, apps are now able to choose a newer version of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package if desired.

### Bug Fixes

1.6-preview2 contains the following new fixes since 1.6-preview1's release:

- Fixed a crash when setting `InfoBar.IsOpen` in .xaml. For more info, see GitHub issue [#8391](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/8391).
- Fixed an issue where HTML elements would lose pointer capture when the mouse moved outside of the `WebView2` bounds. For more info, see GitHub issue [#8677](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/8677).
- Fixed an issue where drag and drop into a flyout with `ShouldConstrainToRootBounds=false` did not work. For more info, see GitHub issue [#9276](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/9276).
- Fixed an issue where `ms-appx://` references did not work when `PublishSingleFile` is enabled. For more info, see GitHub issue [#9468](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/9468).
- Fixed an issue where debugger symbols weren't working correctly for some binaries. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4633](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsappsdk/issues/4633).
- Fixed a build break when using `/permissive-`. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4643](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsappsdk/issues/4643).
- Fixed a couple of API breaking changes in 1.6-preview1 caused by renamed parameters. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4645](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsappsdk/issues/4645).
- Fixed type conflict build breaks hit by some projects in 1.6-preview1, particularly with `Windows.UI.Text` types. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4646](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsappsdk/issues/4646).
- Fixed an issue with resource lookups by control libraries in 1.6-preview1. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4649](https://github.com/microsoft/windowsappsdk/issues/4649).
- Fixed a potential crash when subclassing `NavigationView`.
- Fixed an issue where table borders in a `RichEditBox` would not correctly erase when scrolling or reducing the size of the table.
- Fixed an issue where flyouts from `MediaTransportControls` had a fully transparent background.
- Fixed an issue where dragging into a WebView2 would fail or drop in the wrong location on display scale factors other than 100% or when system text scaling is enabled.
- Fixed an issue where `TextBox`/`RichEditBox` would not announce to Accessibility tools when input is blocked due to being at the `MaxLength` limit.

## Version 1.6 Preview 1 (1.6.0-preview1)

This is the latest release of the preview channel for version 1.6.

In an existing Windows App SDK 1.5 (from the stable channel) app, you can update your Nuget package to 1.6.0-preview1 (see the **Update a package** section in [Install and manage packages in Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#update-a-package)).

For the updated runtime and MSIX, see [Downloads for the Windows App SDK](../downloads.md).

### New features

> [!NOTE]
> The new TitleBar control we released in 1.6-experimental1 is not yet available in non-experimental builds of 1.6 to allow more time to evaluate and respond to community feedback. We received a lot of great input here and want to make sure we take the time needed to address it.

#### Required C# project changes for 1.6-preview1

In 1.6-preview1, Windows App SDK managed apps require [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref) `*.*.*.38`, which can be specified via [WindowsSdkPackageVersion](/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/5.0/override-windows-sdk-package-version) in your `csproj` file. For example:

```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   <PropertyGroup>
       <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
       <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0</TargetFramework>
       <TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
       <WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.22621.38</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>
   <PropertyGroup>
   ...
```

In addition, Windows App SDK managed apps should update to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) `2.1.1` (or later).

#### Native AOT support

The .NET `PublishAot` project property is now supported for native Ahead-Of-Time compilation. For details on Native AOT, see [Native AOT Deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/). Because AOT builds on Trimming support, much of the Trimming-related guidance previously described in the 1.6-experimental1 release applies as well. See [Native AOT support](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/experimental-channel#native-aot-support) for more info.

As noted above, C# projects should have a package reference to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) 2.1.1 (or later).This version includes an AOT-safe `ICustomPropertyProvider` implementation. Types used with this support should be marked with the `WinRT.GeneratedBindableCustomProperty` attribute along with being made `partial`.

#### Changed Edge WebView2 SDK Integration

The Windows App SDK now consumes the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference rather than embedding a hardcoded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK. The new model allows apps to choose a newer version of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package instead of being limited to the version with which the Windows App SDK was built. The new model also allows apps to reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK. For more info, see GitHub issue [#5689](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/5689).

#### New Package Deployment APIs

The Package Management API has received several enhancements including Is\*ReadyOrNewerAvailable\*(), EnsureReadyOptions.RegisterNewerIfAvailable, Is\*Provisioned\*(), IsPackageRegistrationPending(), and several bug fixes. See [PackageManagement.md](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md) and [Pull Request #4453](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453) for more details. 

#### Improved TabView tab tear-out

`TabView` supports a new `CanTearOutTabs` mode which provides an enhanced experience for dragging tabs and dragging out to a new window. When this new option is enabled, tab dragging is very much like the tab drag experience in Edge and Chrome where a new window is immediately created during the drag, allowing the user to drag it to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap the window in one smooth motion. This implementation also doesn't use drag-and-drop APIs, so it isn't impacted by any limitations in those APIs. Notably, tab tear-out is supported in processes running elevated as Administrator.

#### Other notable changes

- We added a new `ColorHelper.ToDisplayName()` API, filling that gap from UWP.
- Added a new `Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages` class, which notably includes a new `PrimaryLanguageOverride` feature. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4523](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4523).
- Unsealed `ItemsWrapGrid`. This should be a backward-compatible change.
- `PipsPager` supports a new mode where it can wrap between the first and list items.
- `RatingControl` is now more customizable, by moving some hard-coded style properties to theme resources. This allows apps to override these values to better customize the appearance of RatingControl.

### Known Issues

- If the debugger is set to break on all C++ exceptions, it will break on a pair of noisy exceptions on start-up in the BCP47 (Windows Globalization) code.

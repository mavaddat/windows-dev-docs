## Version 1.6

The following sections describe new and updated features and known issues for version 1.6.

In an existing Windows App SDK 1.5 app, you can update your Nuget package to 1.6.240829007 (see the **Update a package** section in [Install and manage packages in Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#update-a-package)).

For the updated runtime and MSIX, see [Downloads for the Windows App SDK](./downloads.md).

### Required project changes for 1.6

#### C++ project changes

When updating a C++ project to 1.6, you'll need to add a project reference to the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package. If you update via NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio, this dependency will be added for you.

####  C# project changes

In 1.6, Windows App SDK managed apps require [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref) `*.*.*.38` or later, which can be specified via [WindowsSdkPackageVersion](/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/5.0/override-windows-sdk-package-version) in your `csproj` file. For example:

```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   <PropertyGroup>
       <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
       <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0</TargetFramework>
       <TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
       <WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.22621.38</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>
   <PropertyGroup>
   ...
```

In addition, Windows App SDK managed apps should update to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) `2.1.1` (or later).

>[!NOTE]
> These manual references will no longer be needed once the next .NET SDK servicing update is released.

### Native AOT support

![Native AOT support in 1.6](images/1.6-aot.gif)

The .NET `PublishAot` project property is now supported for native Ahead-Of-Time compilation. For details on Native AOT, see [Native AOT Deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows). Because AOT builds on Trimming support, much of the following trimming-related guidance applies to AOT as well.

For `PublishAot` support and trimming support, in addition to the C# project changes described in the previous section you'll also need a package reference to [Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWinRT) `2.1.1` (or later) to enable the source generator from that package until the next .NET SDK servicing update is released when it will no longer be required. 

For more info, see the [CsWinRT Trimming / AOT support doc](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/blob/master/docs/aot-trimming.md) and the [CsWinRT 2.1.1 Release Notes](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/releases/tag/2.1.1.240807.2).

Because the Windows App SDK invokes publishing targets when F5 deploying, we recommend enabling `PublishAot` at NuGet restore time by adding this to your `csproj` file:

```XML
<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
```

#### Resolving AOT Issues

In this release, the developer is responsible for ensuring that all types are properly rooted to avoid trimming (such as with reflection-based `{Binding}` targets). Later releases will enhance both C#/WinRT and the XAML Compiler to automate rooting where possible, alert developers to trimming risks, and provide mechanisms to resolve.

##### Partial Classes

C#/WinRT also includes `PublishAot` support in version 2.1.1. To enable a class for AOT publishing with C#/WinRT, it must first be marked `partial`. This allows the C#/WinRT AOT source analyzer to attribute the classes for static analysis. Only classes (which contain methods, the targets of trimming) require this attribute.

##### Unsafe Code Error

The CsWinRT source generator might generate code that makes use of `unsafe`. If you hit such an error during compilation or a diagnostic warning for it ([CS0227](/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0227) for "Unsafe code may only appear if compiling with /unsafe"), you should set EnableUnsafeBlocks to true. For more info, see GitHub issue [CsWinRT #1721](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/issues/1721).

##### WebView2 not yet AOT compatible

The WebView2 projections in `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package version 1.0.2651.64 are not yet AOT compatible. This will be fixed in an upcoming release of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package, which you can then reference in your project.

##### Reflection-Free Techniques

To enable AOT compatibility, reflection-based techniques should be replaced with statically typed serialization, AppContext.BaseDirectory, typeof(), etc. For details, see [Introduction to trim warnings](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/fixing-warnings).

##### Rooting Types

Until full support for `{Binding}` is implemented, types may be preserved from trimming as follows:

Given project `P` consuming assembly `A` with type `T` in namespace `N`, which is only dynamically referenced (so normally trimmed), `T` can be preserved via:

`P.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <TrimmerRootDescriptor Include="ILLink.Descriptors.xml" />
</ItemGroup>
```

`ILLink.Descriptors.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<linker>
    <assembly fullname="A">
        <type fullname="N.T" preserve="all" />
    </assembly>
</linker>
```

For complete root descriptor XML expression syntax, see [Root Descriptors](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options?pivots=dotnet-8-0#root-descriptors).

> [!NOTE]
> Dependency packages that have not yet adopted AOT support may exhibit runtime issues.

### Decoupled WebView2 versioning

The Windows App SDK now consumes the Edge WebView2 SDK as a NuGet reference rather than embedding a hardcoded version of the Edge WebView2 SDK. The new model allows apps to choose a newer version of the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package instead of being limited to the version with which the Windows App SDK was built. The new model also allows apps to reference NuGet packages which also reference the Edge WebView2 SDK. For more info, see GitHub issue [#5689](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/5689).

### New Package Deployment APIs

The Package Management API has received several enhancements including Is\*ReadyOrNewerAvailable\*(), EnsureReadyOptions.RegisterNewerIfAvailable, Is\*Provisioned\*(), IsPackageRegistrationPending(), and several bug fixes. See [PackageManagement.md](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/blob/main/specs/packagemanager/PackageManagement.md) and [Pull Request #4453](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4453) for more details. 

### Improved TabView tab tear-out

![Improved TabView tear-out in 1.6](images/1.6-TabView-tear-out.gif)

`TabView` supports a new `CanTearOutTabs` mode which provides an enhanced experience for dragging tabs and dragging out to a new window. When this new option is enabled, tab dragging is very much like the tab drag experience in Edge and Chrome where a new window is immediately created during the drag, allowing the user to drag it to the edge of the screen to maximize or snap the window in one smooth motion. This implementation also doesn't use drag-and-drop APIs, so it isn't impacted by any limitations in those APIs. Notably, tab tear-out is supported in processes running elevated as Administrator.

### Other notable changes

- Added a new `ColorHelper.ToDisplayName()` API, filling that gap from UWP.
- Added a new `Microsoft.Windows.Globalization.ApplicationLanguages` class, which notably includes a new `PrimaryLanguageOverride` feature. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4523](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/pull/4523).
- Unsealed `ItemsWrapGrid`. This should be a backward-compatible change.
- `PipsPager` supports a new mode where it can wrap between the first and last items.

![New PipsPager wrapping mode in 1.6](images/1.6-PipsPager.gif)

- `RatingControl` is now more customizable, by moving some hard-coded style properties to theme resources. This allows apps to override these values to better customize the appearance of RatingControl.

<img src="images/1.6-RatingControl.png" alt="New RatingControl customization in 1.6" width="200"/>

- WinUI 3 has changed to the typographic model for font selection rather than the legacy weight/stretch/style model. The typographic model is required for some newer fonts, including Segoe UI Variable, and enables enhanced font capabilities. Some older fonts which rely on the weight/stretch/style model for selection may not be found with the typographic model.

### Known Issues

- If the debugger is set to break on all C++ exceptions, it will break on some noisy exceptions on start-up in the BCP47 (Windows Globalization) code. For more info, see GitHub issue [#4691](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/4691).
- Component library packages which reference the WinAppSDK 1.6 package will not correctly get the referenced WebView2 package contents. For more info, see [WebView2Feedback #4743](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/4743). A workaround is to add a direct reference to the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package where needed.
- Apps compiled with Native AOT might sometimes experience a hanging issue after page navigation due to a race condition in the .NET runtime's GC thread. For more info, see [.NET issue #104582](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/104582).
- The initial release of 1.6.0 introduced an issue with one of our dependencies that we expect will be resolved in an upcoming release of the .NET SDK. If you experience an error with the version of your Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET reference, you’ll need to explicitly reference the version of the .NET SDK that is specified by your error message. For example, if the error says you need version 10.0.19041.38, add the following to your `.csproj` file:
    - `<WindowsSdkPackageVersion>10.0.19041.38</WindowsSdkPackageVersion>`.

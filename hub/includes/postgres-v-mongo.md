Two [popular choices](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-databases) for a database system are [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/). 

MongoDB is a NoSQL document database designed to work with JSON and store schema-free data. It's good for flexibility and unstructured data, caching real-time analytics, and horizontal scaling. 

PostgreSQL (sometimes referred to as Postgres) is a SQL relational database with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It can handle JSON now too, but it is generally better for structured data, vertical scaling, and ACID-compliant needs like eCommerce and financial transactions.

Schemas:

**PostgreSQL:** Table | Column | Value | Records.

**MongoDB (NoSQL):** Collection | Key | Value | Document.

The sort of database you choose should depend on the type of application you will be using the database with. We recommend that you look up the advantages and disadvantages of structured and unstructured databases and choose based on your use case. There are also several other database systems to consider beyond PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

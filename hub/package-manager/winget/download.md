# download command (winget)

The **download** command of the [winget](index.md) tool downloads the installer, dependencies, and license file (when downloading a Microsoft Store Packaged app). Use the [**search**](search.md) command and the [**show**](show.md) command to identify the package installer you want to download.

The **download** command requires that you specify the exact string to download. If there is any ambiguity, you will be prompted to further filter the **download** command to an exact application.

The **download** command requires [EntraID (formally Azure Active Directory) authentication](/entra/identity/authentication/overview-authentication) to download a Microsoft Store packaged app (*.msix, *.appx, *.msixbundle, or *.appxbundle) and to download the Microsoft Store packaged app license file. The EntraID account used for authentication to generate and retrieve a Microsoft Store packaged app license file must be a member of one of the following three Azure roles: Global Administrator, User Administrator, or License Administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **download** command will download the appropriate installer to the user's Downloads folder. Use the **--download-directory** option to specify a custom download path.

## Usage

`winget download [[-q] <query>] [<options>]`

![download command](./images/download.png)

## Download without license file

Downloading a package using WinGet, the package license file can be omitted by appending to the command the `--skip-license` parameter. The exclusion of the package license file will remove the authorization requirement for generating the offline license file.

```cmd
winget download [[--id] <package id>] [[--skip-license]] [<options>]
```

## Download for a specific platform

Downloading a package using WinGet, by default will download the latest available version of a package for each applicable use case (architecture, device platform, etc.). Filtering the downloaded content for a specific device platform is done by appending to the command the `--platform` parameter.

```cmd
winget download [[--id] <package id>] [[--platform] <platform type> ] [<options>]
```

| Platform | Description |

| Windows.Desktop | Supports being installed on Windows desktop experience |

| Windows.Holographic | Supports being installed on Microsoft HoloLens devices |

## Download for a specific architecture

Downloading a package using WinGet, by default will download the latest available version of a package for each applicable use case (architecture, device platform, etc.). Filtering the downloaded content with a specific architecture is done by appending to the command the `--architecture` parameter.

```cmd
winget download [[--id] <package id>] [[--architecture] <Architecture>] [<options>]
```

| Architecture | Description |
|--|--|
| x86 | 32-bit processor |

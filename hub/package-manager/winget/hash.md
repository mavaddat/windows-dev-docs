# hash command (winget)

The **hash** command of the [winget](index.md) tool generates the SHA256 hash for an installer. This command is used if you need to create a [manifest file](../package/manifest.md) for submitting software to the **Microsoft Community Package Manifest Repository** on GitHub.

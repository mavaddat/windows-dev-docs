# Advanced Paste

PowerToys **Advanced Paste** is a tool that enables you to paste the content from your clipboard into any format needed. It can paste as plain text, markdown, JSON, .txt file, .html file, or .png file directly with the UX or with a direct keystroke invoke. It can also extract and paste the text directly from an image in your clipboard. These actions are executed entirely on your local machine. Additionally, the tool has an AI-powered option that is 100% opt-in and requires entering an OpenAI key in settings.

## Getting started

### Enabling

To start using Advanced Paste, enable it in the PowerToys Settings.

### Activating

Open the **Advanced Paste** window with the activation shortcut (default: <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>). See the [Settings](#settings) section for more information on customizing the activation shortcut and additional shortcut actions.

## Settings

From the Settings menu, the following options can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Enable Paste with AI | Enables the AI-powered paste feature. An OpenAI API key is required (requires an account on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)). See [Paste text with AI](#paste-text-with-ai) for more information. |
| Enable advanced AI | Enables the Advanced AI feature which allows [Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/overview/) to be used to define a chain of actions to be performed when using "Paste with AI". See [Paste with Advanced AI](#paste-with-advanced-ai) for more information.<br/><br/>This setting is off and disabled when Enable Paste with AI is disabled. When enabling Enable Paste with AI, Enable advanced AI is also enabled by default, allowing users immediate access to the feature. |
| Custom format preview | Enable to preview the output of the custom format before pasting. |
| Clipboard history | Enable to automatically save clipboard history. |
| Open Advanced Paste shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to open the **Advanced Paste** window. |
| Automatically close the Advanced Paste window after it loses focus | Determines whether the Advanced Paste window will close after focus is lost from the window. |
| Custom Actions | When using Paste with AI, save the prompts you frequently use and give them descriptive names, so you can easily select them from the Advanced Paste window without having to type them out. You can also assign each action a keyboard command, so you can execute them without opening the Advanced Paste window. |
| Paste as plain text directly shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to paste as plain text without opening the **Advanced Paste** window. |
| Paste as Markdown directly shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to paste as Markdown without opening the **Advanced Paste** window. |
| Paste as JSON directly shortcut | The customizable keyboard command to paste as JSON without opening the **Advanced Paste** window. |
| Additional actions: Image to Text | Turn on/off the Image to text paste action and configure the customizable keyboard command. |
| Additional actions: Paste as file | Turn on/off the set of Paste as File actions which include Paste as .txt file, Paste as .png file, Paste as .html file. Optionally configure the customizable keyboard command for each of these actions. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's possible to set <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> as an activation shortcut. This is not recommended, as overriding this shortcut may have unintended consequences.

## Advanced text paste

Advanced Paste includes several text-based paste options. These options are available in the **Advanced Paste** window, which can be opened using the activation shortcut. You can also use the customizable keyboard commands to directly invoke a paste action with quick keys.

### Paste as Plain Text

**Paste as Plain Text** enables you to paste text stored in your clipboard, excluding any text-formatting, using a quick key shortcut. Any formatting included with the clipboard text will be replaced with an unformatted version of the text.

### Paste as JSON

**Paste as JSON** enables you to paste text stored in your clipboard, updating any text-formatting to JSON, using a quick key shortcut. Any formatting included with the clipboard text will be replaced with a JSON formatted version of the text.

Sample input:

```xml
<note>
    <to>Mr. Smith</to>
    <from>Ms. Nguyen</from>
    <body>Do you like PowerToys?</body>
</note>
```

JSON output:

```json
{
    "note": {
        "to": "Mr. Smith",
        "from": "Ms. Nguyen",
        "body": "Do you like PowerToys?"
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as JSON is a feature that runs locally and doesn't use AI.

### Paste as Markdown

**Paste as Markdown** enables you to paste text stored in your clipboard, updating any text-formatting to markdown, using a quick key shortcut. Any formatting included with the clipboard text will be replaced with a markdown formatted version of the text.

Sample input:

```html
<b>Paste</b> <i>as</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
```

Markdown output:

```md
**Paste** *as* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as Markdown is a feature that runs locally and doesn't use AI.

### Paste as .txt file

**Paste as .txt file** enables you to paste text stored in your clipboard as a .txt file with an auto-generated file name. You can optionally set a quick key shortcut in settings.

Sample input:

```text
Hello World!
```

If pasting files is accepted within the application that you are using (e.g. File Explorer), then the paste as .txt file action will take the input text and paste a .txt file.

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as .txt file is a feature that runs locally and doesn't use AI.

### Paste as .html file

**Paste as .html file** enables you to paste html data stored in your clipboard as a .html file with an auto-generated file name. This is especially useful for saving a part of a webpage from a browser - including links, formatted text and images. You can optionally set a quick key shortcut in settings.

If pasting files is accepted within the application that you are using (e.g. File Explorer), then the paste as .html file action will take the input data and paste a .html file.

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as .html file is a feature that runs locally and doesn't use AI.

### Paste text with AI

When you paste text with AI, the text is analyzed and formatted based on the context of the text and the prompt provided to the OpenAI call. This feature requires that an OpenAI API key be provided in the PowerToys settings, and that you have available credits in your account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use this feature and see an error `API key quota exceeded`, that means you do not have credits in your OpenAI account and would need to purchase them.

Some examples of how this feature can be used include:

- **Summarize text**: Take long text from the clipboard and ask the AI to summarize it.
- **Translate text**: Take the text from the clipboard in one language and ask the AI to translate it to another language.
- **Generate code**: Take a description of a function from the clipboard and ask the AI to generate the code for it.
- **Transform text**: Take text from the clipboard and ask the AI to rewrite it in a specific style, such as a professional email or a casual message.
- **Stylize text**: Take text from the clipboard and ask the AI to rewrite it in the style of a well-known author, book, or speaker.

You could ask the AI to paste the text as if it were written by Mark Twain or Shakespeare, for example, or to summarize a long case study. The possibilities are endless.

Sample input:

> The new Advanced Paste feature in PowerToys is now available. You can use it to save time and improve your writing.

AI output when prompting to "Format the text as if it were written by Mark Twain":

> Say, have you heard the news? The newfangled Advanced Paste feature in PowerToys is finally here! It's a nifty tool that's sure to save you time and spruce up your writing. If you're in the market for a bit of writing wizardry, this here Advanced Paste just might be the ticket for ya.

> [!NOTE]
> As with any AI tool, the quality of the output is dependent on the quality of the input. The more context you provide, the better the AI will be able to understand and respond to your request. Be sure to carefully review the output before using it. Please see OpenAI's [privacy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [terms](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) pages for more info on AI usage in this feature.

### Paste with Advanced AI

This feature uses [Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/overview/) to allow you to define a chain of actions to be performed when using "Paste with AI". Using this feature you can:

- Work with non-text input such as images.
- Produce non-text output like files.
- Chain multiple actions together and execute them in sequence. For example, Image to text --> Text to JSON text --> JSON text to .txt file.
- Produce meaningful AI-generated error messages.

For these example commands, assume there is an image in the clipboard that contains some text that you would like to save to a text file in another language. You can phrase multiple steps explicitly:

```
Convert this image to text using OCR, translate the text to French, and then save the text as a .txt file.
```

Or you can phrase the steps to be more implicit:

```
Translate to French and save as a .txt file.
```

## Advanced image paste

Advanced Paste includes several image-based paste options. These options are available in the **Advanced Paste** window, which can be opened using the activation shortcut. You can optionally set a quick key shortcut in settings.

### Paste Image to text

**Paste image to text** enables you to extract the text from an image in your clipboard and quickly paste the extracted text, using a quick key shortcut.

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as Image to text is a feature that runs locally using local OCR.

### Paste as .png file

**Paste as .png file** enables you to quickly paste an image format, like a bitmap, to a .png file. You can optionally create a quick key shortcut to invoke this paste action.

> [!NOTE]
> Paste as .png file is a feature that runs locally and doesn't use AI.

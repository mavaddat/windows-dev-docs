# Create your first app

Welcome to the [UWP platform](universal-application-platform-guide.md)! These tutorials will help you create your first UWP app in the language of your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are starting to develop Windows apps, we recommend you consider using the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), and [WinUI](/windows/apps/develop/) rather than UWP. Although still supported, UWP is not under active development. Please see [Start developing Windows apps](/windows/apps/get-started/start-here) for more information.


To get started, choose your favorite language.

## C# and XAML

Use your .NET, WPF, or Silverlight skills to build apps using C# with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

* [Create a "Hello, World!" app using XAML with C#](create-a-hello-world-app-xaml-universal.md)

If you want to learn the basics, or just refresh your memory, try reading these:

* [VB Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](/training/?l=jqMOvLKbC_9206218965)
* [Develop Windows 10 applications](/training/paths/develop-windows10-apps/)

## C++/WinRT and XAML

Leverage your programming expertise in standard C++ to build apps using C++/WinRT with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

* [Create a "Hello, World!" app using C++/WinRT](create-a-basic-windows-10-app-in-cppwinrt.md)

Learn more about C++/WinRT.

* [C++/WinRT](../cpp-and-winrt-apis/index.md)

## Visual C++ component extensions (C++/CX) and XAML

Take advantage of your C++ programming expertise to build apps using Visual C++ component extensions (C++/CX) with Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

* [Create a "Hello, World!" app with C++/CX](create-a-basic-windows-10-app-in-cpp.md)
